# react-course - 2023

This is "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)" course from Udemy provided by Maximilian Schwarzmüller.

Commit messages used to display what I did each day to show continuity and that the course can be finished in two weeks. But then I messed around and deleted the entire commit history, so no commit messages for you. All the content is still the same though.

### Stats

- Amount of course content: 50h
- Time spent on this course: 90h (average of 7h a day)
